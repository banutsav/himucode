programs:

- title: |
    WAP to input a number **n** and print the **first n terms** of the following series
    2,5,8,11,13,17,....uptil n terms
    For example: If the value of n = 5, then your program should print out the following
    2,5,8,11,13 (n = 5 terms)

  code: ''

- title: 
    WAP to print out and also find the sum of the following series 
    1 +11 + 111 + 1111 + .. uptil **n terms**
    where **n** is taken as an input by the program

  code: ''

- title: |
    WAP to print out and calculate the sumof the following series
    1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + 1/5 -... 1/n
    where **n** is a positive integer and input by user.

- title: |
    WAP to take an input n from the user and find the sum of the following series
    ½ + ¼ + ⅙ + ⅛ + 1/10 + 1/12 + …. + 1/2n
    The value of n indicates the number of terms.
    For example, if the input n = 5, then the series will be 
    ½ + ¼ + ⅙ + ⅛ + 1/10 i.e. n = 5 terms

  code: |
    
    import java.util.*;
    public class Loops
    {
        public static void main()
        {
        int n;
        float i, a, s = 0;
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.println("enter thember");
        n = sc.nextInt();
        
        for (i = 1; i<= n; i++)
        {
            a = (1/(2*i));
            s += a;
            System.out.println(a);
        }
        System.out.println("Sum of the numbers = " + s);
        }
    }

- title: |
    WAP to input a number **n** and print the **first n terms** of the following series
    0, 3, 8, 15, 24, 35, 48, 63, 80, 99....uptil n terms
    For example: If the value of n = 4, then your program should print out the following
    0,3,8,15 (n = 4 terms)

  code: ''

- title: |
    Take an input n from the user and find out the sum of the following series
    ½ + ⅔ + ¾ + ⅘ + … till n number of terms
    For example, if the value of n = 5, then the series will be
    ½ + ⅔ + ¾+ ⅘ + ⅚ (so, the series will have 5 terms)
  
  code: |
    
    import java.util.*;
    public class Loops
    {
        public static void main()
        {
        int n;
        float i, a, s = 0;
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.println("enter thember");
        n = sc.nextInt();
        
        for (i = 1; i<= n; i++)
        {
            a = (i/(i + 1));
            s += a;
            System.out.println(a);
        }
        System.out.println("Sum of the numbers = " + s);
        }
    }

    Take an input n from the user and find out the sum of the following series
    2/1 + 3/2 +4/3 + 5/4 + … till n number of terms
    For example, if the value of n = 5, then the series will be
    2/1 + 3/2 + 4/3+ 5/4 + 6/5 (so, the series will have 5 terms)
  
  code: ''

- title: |
    Take an input n from the user and find the sum of the following series till n terms
    ⅕ + 1/10 + 1/15 + 1/20 + …. Till n terms.
    So, for example if the input of n = 6, the series will have 6 terms which are
    ⅕ + 1/10 + 1/15 + 1/20 + 1/25 + 1/30

        public static void main()
        {
        int n;
        float i, a, s = 0;
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.println("enter thember");
        n = sc.nextInt();
        
        for (i = 1; i<= n; i++)
        {
            a = (1/(5*i));
            s += a;
            System.out.println(a);
        }
        System.out.println("Sum of the numbers = " + s);
        }
