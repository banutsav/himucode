    WAP to display **n terms** of square natural number and their sum, where n is an input
    For example if n = 4 then the program should print out the series
    1,4,9,16 and the sum 1+4+9+16 = 30

        n = sc.nextInt();
        
        for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
        {
            System.out.println("enter number");
            a = sc.nextInt();
            
            // check if positive
            if (a > 0)
            {
                pos++;
            }
