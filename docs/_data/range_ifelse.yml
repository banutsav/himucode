    A bank accepts fixed deposits for one year or more and the policy it adopts on interest is as follows.
     - If a deposit is less than Rs.2000 and for 2 or more years, the interest rate is 5% compounded annualy.
     - If a deposit is Rs.2000 or more but less than Rs.6000 and for 2 or more years, the interest rate is 7% compounded annualy. 
     - If a deposit is more than Rs.6000 and is for 1 year or more, the interest rate is 8% compounded annualy.
     - On all deposits of 5 years or more, interest is 10% compounded annualy.
     - On all other deposits not covered by the above conditions, the interest is 3% compounded annualy.

     Given the amount deposited and the number of years, WAP to calculate the money in the customer's account at the end of the specified time

    WAP to take the age of a person, the principal amount taken as loan by the person 
    and the time for which the loan is taken.
    Depending on the time for which the loan is taken
    , calculate the simple interest that has to be payable by the person 
    based on the conditions below

    *If Age is below 60*

    | Time in Years | Rate of Interest |
    | --- | --- |
    | <= 5 | 4.5 |
    | 6 to 10 | 6 |
